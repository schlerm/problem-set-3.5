  <h1>Climbing Equipment</h1>
  <br>
  <br>

  <h2>Chalk</h2>
    <p>Chalk is a powder primarily made of magnesium carbonate. It is used by rubbing it on the hands to keep them dry and increase
      the amount of grip a climber has. Chalk is extremely important for climbing at all grades. Climbing without chalk can make it
      nearly impossible, especially at high grades. Some good brands include <a href="https://shop.frictionlabs.com/collections/chalk/products/high-performance-chalk?variant=6929287171" target="_blank">FrictionLabs</a>
      or <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/White-Gold-Chalk-Black-Diamond/dp/B0000E5LTR/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1539105041&sr=8-1&keywords=black+diamond+white+gold" target="_blank">Black Diamond White Gold</a>.
      Some chalks some in <a href="https://shop.frictionlabs.com/collections/chalk/products/secret-stuff-75ml" target="_blank">liquid form</a>
      for a better drying effect and more uniform application. The chalk is inside of a isopropyl alcohol solution and when the alcohol
      dries off quickly due to body heat, it leaves only chalk.</p>

  <h2>Shoes</h2>
    <p>Rock climbing shoes are essential to climbing. Your feet are much more important than the arms on the wall and without
      good shoes, you can't climb efficiently or on higher grades. Shoes are generally very light and have a very sticky rubber on the heel,
      sole, and toe. Some shoes, like the <a href="https://www.sportiva.com/men-s/men-s-footwear/miura.html" target="_blank">La Sportiva Miura</a>
      are very stiff and downturned and are designed for sport climbing routes where you really need to stand on your shoes but also may need
      to climb on an overhang, which the downturn is for. Other shoes like the <a href="https://www.sportiva.com/men-s/men-s-footwear/solution.html" target="_blank">La Sportiva Solution</a>
      are great for bouldering because they are very soft in the middle with a massive downturn, allowing you to really grab the holds
      with your toes on steep overhangs. The solution is not comfortable to wear for long periods, which is why it is a bouldering shoe.</p>

  <h2>Harness</h2>
    <p>A rock climbing harness is used if you are doing climbing that involves rope such as toprope or lead. It is worn around the waist and legs
      and you tie a rope through some  loops on the harness. If you fall, the rope will catch you and you can just sit in the harness.
      An example of one is the <a href="https://www.petzl.com/US/en/Sport/Harnesses/SAMA" target="_blank">Petzl Sama</a>.</p>
  <br>
  <h2>Other Equipment</h2>
    <p>Disciplines such as sport and trad require a lot more equipment, which is alot to explain. The basics is that they require cams,
      nuts, quickdraws, ropes of a few different kinds, helmets, porta-ledges (bigwall), drills(for setting a new route), and much more.
      For more information, you can do a bit of googling to find out what equipment you need.</p>
