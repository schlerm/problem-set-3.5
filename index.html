    <h1>The Sport of Rock Climbing</h1>
    <br>
    <img src="./images/ondra.jpg" width=35% height=35%/>
    <p>Rock climbing is pretty self explanatory as a sport. It is very specialized in terms of the type of fitness the athletes must be.
      It is also very fun with a weloming community and is very beginner friendly. Also, it has recently become an olympic sport.
      <br>
      The sport is rather dangerous depending on the type of climbing and is also very mentally demanding and skill based. Some types of
      climbing are more dangerous than the other. We will go into more detail on this in the other pages.
