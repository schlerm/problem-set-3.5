  <h2>What Kind of Fitness Does Rock Climbing Require?</h2>
    <p>Rock climbing requires climbers to smiply maintain a good diet and active lifestyle. You don't exactly need to eat large amount of
      protein and use specialized diets. Eat healthily and you will be okay. The types of strength that rock climbing requires is a lot
      more specialized. The most important strength in rock climbing is in the arms, back, core, and most importantly, the forearms and
      tendons in that area. Your fingers also have pulleys that hold the tendons in place that need to be strengthened. Some elite level
      rock climbers can hold their entire bodyweight on just one finger and do pullups. This is because their tendons and pulleys have
      been strengthened. Strenghening tendons and pulleys takes many months and years to do becuase they are not muscle, so be careful
      early on in your climbing adventures. Tendonitis and pulley strains/ruptures takes months to heal and in the case of pulley ruptures,
      may require surgery.</p>
